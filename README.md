# 📡 D2D Resource Allocation using Genetic Algorithm (MATLAB)

![Banner](assets/banner.png)

This project implements an **optimization system for relay and resource allocation** in Device-to-Device (D2D) communication using a **Resource Grouping Scheme**.  
The core algorithm used is the **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, developed and simulated in **MATLAB R2020**.
